# Reves-Puzzle-Solver
A program to optimally solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and its variation, Reve's puzzle, with any number of disks.

This program is pretty simple. Just open the Google Colab file on Github, run the first cell (either by clicking "run", hitting ctrl-Enter on Windows, or cmd-Enter on Mac), and run whichever other parts of the program you want! Currently, you can solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, solve Reve's puzzle, and find the optimal split to solve Reve's puzzle with the Frame-Stewart algorithm.
